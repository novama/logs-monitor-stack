## Features

- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting toolkit for collecting and querying metrics.
- **Grafana**: Visualization and analytics platform.
- **Loki**: Log aggregation system designed to work with Grafana.
- **Promtail**: Agent for shipping logs to Loki.
- **Alloy**: Scraper for Docker metrics.
- **Minio**: High-performance object storage service.
- **Nginx (Gateway)**: Acts as a reverse proxy to route requests to the correct Loki service.
- **Flog**: Generates fake logs for testing.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment.

## Architecture Overview

The Logs Monitor Stack is composed of several interconnected components, each fulfilling a specific role:

- **Loki**: Serves as the centralized logging system. It is split into read, write, and backend components to handle log ingestion, querying, and storage.
- **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics, which can be visualized in Grafana.
- **Grafana**: Acts as the front-end for visualizing both metrics (from Prometheus) and logs (from Loki).
- **Promtail**: Collects logs from the local system and forwards them to Loki.
- **Alloy**: Scrapes Docker metrics and forwards them to Loki.
- **Minio**: Provides S3-compatible storage for Loki’s log data.
- **Nginx (Gateway)**: Routes HTTP requests to the appropriate Loki components.
- **Flog**: Generates test logs to simulate real-world logging scenarios.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Orthotech1/log-monitor-stack.git
   cd log-monitor-stack/docker
   ```

2. Create the necessary directories for Loki and Minio data storage:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ../.data/minio
   sudo mkdir -p /path/to/your/loki/data
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /path/to/your/loki/data
   ```

## Configuration

- **Alloy** configuration: [alloy/alloy-local-config.yml](./docker/config/alloy/alloy-local-config.yml)
- **Grafana** data sources configuration: [grafana/grafana-datasources.yml](./docker/config/grafana/grafana-datasources.yml)
- **Loki** configuration: [loki/loki-config.yml](./docker/config/loki/loki-config.yml)
- **nginx** configuration: [nginx/nginx-config.conf](./docker/config/nginx/nginx-config.conf)
- **Prometheus** configuration: [prometheus/prometheus-config.yml](./docker/config/prometheus/prometheus-config.yml)
- **Promtail** configuration: [promtail/promtail-config.yml](./docker/config/promtail/promtail-config.yml)


## Usage

### Start the Docker containers

   ```sh
   cd docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Validate Loki Startup

   Check the logs to ensure Loki starts correctly:

   ```sh
   docker-compose logs loki-backend
   ```

### Accessing and Configuring Loki in Grafana

1. **Access Grafana**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Log in with the default credentials (`admin` / `admin`).

   ![Grafana Login](../misc/grafana-login.png)

   **Notes:**
   ***For testing purposes only***: You can modify your `docker-compose.yml` file and add the following environment variables for the `grafana` service and you will disable the login screen, activating anonymous access with administrator permissions:
   
   ```yml
   environment:
      - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED=true
      - GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE=Admin
   ```

   **Grafana Configuration:**
   Grafana stores its configuration in a local `grafana.ini` file. In Linux environments, your configuration file is located at `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`

   You can override configuration settings with environment variables.
   To override an option:
   ```yml
   environment:
      - GF_<SectionName>_<KeyName>=<Value>
   ```
   For more information about this, please visit the [official documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#override-configuration-with-environment-variables)

2. **Add Loki as a Data Source**:
   This step is not necessary if you have used the `docker-compose.yml`, as the Loki datasource has been automatically added by configuration.

   If you need to manually connect Grafana to Loki:
   - In Grafana, go to **Configuration** (the gear icon) > **Data Sources**.
   - Click **Add data source**.
   - Select **Loki** from the list of available data sources.
   - Configure the data source with the following settings:
     - **URL**: `http://localhost:3100`
     - Leave other settings at their defaults.
   - Click **Save & Test** to verify the connection.

3. **Create a Dashboard and Explore Logs**:
   - Go to **Create** (the plus icon) > **New dashboard**.
   - Click **Add visualization**.
   - Select **Loki** as the data source.
   - Enter a log query to visualize logs. For example:
     ```logql
     {system_logs="varlogs"}
     ```
   - Click **Save** to save the panel to the dashboard.

## Logging Examples

### Python Logging

For an example of logging in Python, see the [Python logging example](./examples/python).
Make sure you install the dependencies for the example defined in the `requirements.txt` file.
```shell
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### C# Logging

For an example of logging in C#, see the [C# logging example](./examples/csharp).

### C++ Logging

For an example of logging in C++, see the [C++ logging example](./examples/cpp).
Make sure you install the dependencies for the example defined in the `vcpkg.json` file.
```shell
vcpkg install
```

## Troubleshooting

### Loki Not Receiving Logs

- **Promtail**: Ensure that Promtail is correctly pointing to the Loki endpoint and is running without errors.
- **Alloy**: Check that Alloy is correctly scraping Docker metrics and forwarding them to Loki.

### Grafana Dashboard Not Displaying Data

- Verify that the Loki data source is correctly configured and connected in Grafana.
- Check the logs of the Grafana container to ensure it's functioning properly.

### Service Health Checks

- **Loki Services**: Check the health status of the `loki-read`, `loki-write`, and `loki-backend` services.
- **Grafana**: Ensure Grafana’s health check returns a successful status.
- **Minio**: Verify that Minio is accessible and functioning properly.

## Security Considerations

- **Credentials Management**: Store sensitive data like `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` securely, preferably using environment variables or Docker secrets.
- **Secure Networking**: Consider securing network communication between services using Docker networks or external firewalls.
- **Grafana Authentication**: If anonymous access is enabled, be aware of the security implications. Use strong passwords and consider enabling authentication in production environments.

## Scaling the Stack

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Loki**: Add more read and write nodes to distribute the load. Ensure that the `loki-config.yml` is updated accordingly.
- **Grafana**: Deploy Grafana in a high-availability setup with load balancing.

### Prometheus Scaling

- **Remote Storage**: Consider setting up remote storage for Prometheus metrics if the volume becomes too large.
- **Multiple Instances**: Deploy multiple Prometheus instances for high availability.

## Backup and Restore

### Loki Data

- **Minio**: Back up the Minio data directory (`/path/to/your/minio/data`) regularly.
- **S3-Compatible Storage**: Use an S3-compatible tool to back up the logs stored in Minio.

### Prometheus Data

- **Snapshots**: Create snapshots of Prometheus data periodically and store them in a secure location.

### Grafana Dashboards

- **Export/Import**: Use Grafana’s export/import feature to back up dashboards. Store these JSON files in version control.

## Updating the Stack

### Updating Docker Images

- Pull the latest versions of the Docker images and restart the containers:
  ```sh
  docker-compose pull
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

### Configuration Changes

- Safely apply configuration changes by editing the relevant files and restarting the affected services:
  ```sh
  docker-compose up -d <service_name>
  ```

## Resource Requirements

### CPU & Memory Usage

- **Loki**: Ensure that Loki has sufficient memory and CPU resources, especially if handling high volumes of logs.
- **Prometheus**: Allocate enough resources to Prometheus, as it can be resource-intensive.

### Storage Requirements

- **Minio**: Estimate storage needs based on log volume and allocate sufficient disk space.
- **Loki**: Ensure that the storage backend (Minio) is performant and has enough capacity for long-term log retention.

## Metrics and Logs Visualization

### Example Dashboards

- Create dashboards in Grafana

 that visualize key metrics and logs. Example dashboards could include:
  - **System Health**: CPU, memory, and disk usage.
  - **Log Analysis**: Error rates, log frequency, and anomaly detection.

### Log Queries

- **Error Monitoring**: 
  ```logql
  {system_logs="varlogs"} |= "error"
  ```
- **Performance Metrics**:
  ```logql
  {system_logs="varlogs"} | duration > 100ms
  ```
